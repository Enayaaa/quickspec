# Future Work

* Type class constraints in functions

* Polymorphic application of functions (i.e. find natural transformations)

* Relations

* Imperative programs

## Small TODOs

* Hide output of background theories
  - Can we safely disable (or limit) completion with background
    theories?

* Add QS1 feature of organising laws by defining function
  (i.e., "this is a law about BLAH")
