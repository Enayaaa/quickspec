Port all possible old QS examples to new QS
Switch from depth to size?!
For things like modifiers (sortedList etc.): if a type has no terms of depth 1 (only depth 2), terms of that type should have their depth reduced by 1. Brittle, though: what about variables?
Add definitions and missing terms warnings.
Add user-accessible term generator like in Erlang QS?
Add "ask why equation not printed."
Introduce Equations.hs and typeclass for things with vars in (so that we can disambiguate either terms or equations).
Add disambiguation in sampleTerms.
Rename observer0 -> observer1 etc.

Make test return a [[Term]] instead of a TestTree, so that we can get
rid of TestTree.discrete. Maybe newtype Classes a = Classes [[a]].

Regexes: use Brzozowski derivatives to get a useful specification
