Write wrapper around TypeRep to get around lack of Ord instance in old
GHC versions + bug in new versions. (How to work around the bug?
Tinkering required!)

Print warnings if two constants with the same name+type.

Rename C to O and use type List = [].

Give proper errors if use several observers in signature etc.

Represent Term a as pair (UntypedTerm, Eval a).

Replace C . f . unC with fmap f, or at least add mapSomeC etc.

Give a warning if there aren't any variables of a particular type.

Clean up existential/witness handling.
